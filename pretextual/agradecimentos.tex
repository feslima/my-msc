    To my mother Lígia, my brother Gustavo and my father Enildo. You are the 
    why I remember things are going to be okay in my best and direst moments.

    To Victor and Paloma, for the moments, either good or bad. I will remember 
    and cherish them all. Seriously, thank you.

    To my supervisor Brandão, for the ideias and guidance.

    To Rodolpho, Ranny and Claudemi, for being awesome friends I have met 
    during this journey.
