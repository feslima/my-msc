  abstract = {Abstract In this work a methodology is presented for the rigorous optimization of nonlinear programming problems in which the objective function and (or) some constraints are represented by noisy implicit black box functions. The special application considered is the optimization of modular process simulators in which the derivatives are not available and some unit operations introduce noise preventing the calculation of accurate derivatives. The black box modules are substituted by metamodels based on a kriging interpolation that assumes that the errors are not independent but a function of the independent variables. A Kriging metamodel uses non-Euclidean measure of distance to avoid sensitivity to the units of measure. It includes adjustable parameters that weigh the importance of each variable for obtaining a good model representation, and it allows calculating errors that can be used to establish stopping criteria and provide a solid base to deal with “possible infeasibility” due to inaccuracies in the metamodel representation of objective function and constraints. The algorithm continues with a refining stage and successive bound contraction in the domain of independent variables with or without kriging recalibration until an acceptable accuracy in the metamodel is obtained. The procedure is illustrated with several examples. © 2008 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2008},

  abstract = {This paper describes the application of self-optimizing control to a large-scale process, the HDA plant. The idea is to select controlled variables which when kept constant lead to minimum economic loss. First, the optimal active constraints need to be controlled. Next, controlled variables need to be found for the remaining unconstrained degrees of freedom. In order to avoid the combinatorial problem related to the selection of outputs/measurements for such large plants, a local (linear) analysis based on singular value decomposition (SVD) is used for pre-screening. This is followed by a more detailed analysis using the nonlinear model. Note that a steady-state model, in this case one built in Aspen PlusTM, is sufficient for selecting controlled variables. A dynamic model is required to design and test the complete control system which include regulatory control. This is considered in the part II of the series.},

  abstract = {High CO2 purity products can be obtained from oxy-combustion power plants through a CO2 CPU (compression and purification unit) based on phase separation method. To ensure that CPU (with double flash separators) can be operated under optimal conditions, this paper focuses on single variable analysis, multi-variable optimization, dynamic simulation and control system design for CPU in oxy-combustion power plants. It is found that optimal operating conditions are 30 bar, 30.42 °C, −24.64 °C, and −55 °C for multi-stage CO2 compressor discharge pressure, flue gas temperature after compression, first flash separator temperature, and second flash separator temperature, respectively. The designed double temperature control structure based on a systematic top-down analysis and bottom-up design method is more suitable than the single temperature control structure under different operating scenarios (load change and flue gas composition ramp change). To bear operating disturbances, operating strategies like elevating temperature, manipulating valves and adjusting setpoints are proposed. Influence of SOx would be more obvious than that of NOx, whilst the kij mixing parameters in Peng–Robinson property method affects little on process optimization and control system design. Comprehensive dynamic model with specified control system provides possibility to integrate CPU with full-train oxy-combustion power plants.},

  abstract = {Oxy-fuel combustion is suggested as one of the possible, promising technologies for capturing CO2 from power plants. The concept of oxy-fuel combustion is removal of nitrogen from the oxidizer to carry out the combustion process in oxygen and, in most concepts, recycled flue gas to lower the flame temperature. The flue gas produced thus consists primarily of carbon dioxide and water. Much research on the different aspects of an oxy-fuel power plant has been performed during the last decade. Focus has mainly been on retrofits of existing pulverized-coal-fired power plant units. Green-field plants which provide additional options for improvement of process economics are however likewise investigated. Of particular interest is the change of the combustion process induced by the exchange of carbon dioxide and water vapor for nitrogen as diluent. This paper reviews the published knowledge on the oxy-fuel process and focuses particularly on the combustion fundamentals, i.e. flame temperatures and heat transfer, ignition and burnout, emissions, and fly ash characteristics. Knowledge is currently available regarding both an entire oxy-fuel power plant and the combustion fundamentals. However, several questions remain unanswered and more research and pilot plant testing of heat transfer profiles, emission levels, the optimum oxygen excess and inlet oxygen concentration levels, high and low-temperature fire-side corrosion, ash quality, plant operability, and models to predict NOx and SO3 formation is required.},

  abstract = {The awareness of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions has resulted in the development of new technologies with lower emissions and technologies that can accommodate capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide. For existing coal-fired combustion plants there are two main options for CO2 capture: removal of nitrogen from flue gases or removal of nitrogen from air before combustion to obtain a gas stream ready for geo-sequestration. In oxy-fuel combustion, fuel is combusted in pure oxygen rather than air. This technology recycles flue gas back into the furnace to control temperature and makeup the volume of the missing N2 to ensure there is sufficient gas to maintain the temperature and heat flux profiles in the boiler. A further advantage of the technology revealed in pilot-scale tests is substantially reduced NOx emissions. For coal-fired combustion, the technology was suggested in the eighties, however, recent developments have led to a renewed interest in the technology. This paper provides a comprehensive review of research that has been undertaken, gives the status of the technology development and assessments providing comparisons with other power generation options, and suggests research needs.},

As a consequence, the oxy-fuel technology has the highest requirement towards CO2 purification. In the current paper two different purification processes are modeled in Aspen Plus™ based on a Peng–Robinson property method with kij mixing coefficients. Both separation processes are based on phase separation technique. The first one is equipped with two flash columns and the second one includes a distillation column. Both plants require a dehydration plant for water removal. For each process the impact of main design parameters on performance features such as specific power requirement, specific cooling duty, separation efficiency and CO2 purity are analyzed, including variations in flue gas composition, plant load and kij mixing parameters. The results were compared to a conventional 5-stage CO2 compressor.},

  abstract = {Compression and purification unit (CPU) is a common industrial process for capturing CO2 from oxy-fuel combustion where high energy requirement is one of its disadvantages. This study focuses on analyzing of the sensitivity and optimizing multi-objectively the operating conditions of CPU, using response surface methodology (RSM). The main objective was to increase the efficiency of CO2 removal from the oxy-fuel combustion power plant. Statistical analysis reveals that reducing the first separator temperature, not only, plays a major role in CO2 separation, but also, it decreases the total work and heat duty of the process. It was found that the optimal multi-stage CO2 compressor discharge pressure was 25.34 bar while regular pressure for this process was reported as 30 bar. Furthermore, the optimal flue gas temperature before, between and after compression, and the first and second flash separator temperatures were 20 °C, 20 °C, 20.6 °C, −38.2 °C, and −55 °C, respectively. with the previous works carried out in a constant amount of CO2 separation, the proposed process leads to lower pressure, and therefore lower operating and capital costs.},
