\chapter{Case studies applied in \mtc}

In this chapter will be presented three case studies of \soc that are applied 
in the \mtc software. Each one of them use different objective function 
criteria with varying complexity. They are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A \co compression purification unit (CPU). The 
    optimization criteria here is the performance enhancement of the 
    process through the reduction in the energy consumption;
    \nomenclature[A]{CPU}{Compression Purification Unit}

    \item A hydrocarbon distillation column. The optimization criteria is the 
    minimization of nominal setpoint deviation;

    \item An isomerization process that seeks to convert \textit{n}-butane 
    into isobutane. The objective is maximization of profits;
\end{enumerate}
